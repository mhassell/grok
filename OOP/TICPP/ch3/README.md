Chapter 3 notes

extern vs static variables:

	1. extern is global (visible everywhere) and therefore persistent (value exists after function calls, for example). It also seems that it needs to be defined in another file for extern to work?

	2. static is persistent (isn't destroyed after a function call, for example, but isn't available outside of its scope)
