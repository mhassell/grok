I think the time has come to delve into OOP with C++.  I'd really like to get a 
grasp on templates and generic programming in C++, and it seems a big part of this
also involves classes, so here we go.

First goal (after playing with some basics): 

Matrix and vector classes with overloaded operators for math operations.
