grok project files

So this is long overdue, but I need to get this project rolling.  Grok is where I plan to place some careful explanations and code for various topics I'd like to "grok."  There's so many important areas in applied math and computer programming that I feel I should know about, and this is where I'm going to document my journey into understanding them.  It is also a convenient place to store references to the material for later use.

Here's a list of current grok projects I'm working on:

1. Linear Programming and it's variants (integer, mixed integer, etc.)

Future grok projects:

1. Basic search algorithms

2. Graph algorithms

3. Kalman filter

4. Signal processing (at least the basics)

5. Threading and async programming

6. Network programming (at least the basics)

7. Geometric interpretation of Gaussian elimination (probably not enough for it's own thing, but super important for LP).
