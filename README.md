grok project files

So this is long overdue, but I need to get this project rolling.  Grok is where I plan to place some careful explanations and code for various topics I'd like to "grok."  There's so many important areas in applied math and computer programming that I feel I should know about, and this is where I'm going to document my journey into understanding them.  It is also a convenient place to store references to the material for later use.
