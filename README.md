# grok

grok project files

So this is long overdue, but I need to get this project rolling.  Grok is where I plan to place some careful explanations and code for various topics I'd like to "grok."  There's so many important areas in applied math and computer programming that I feel I should know about, and this is where I'm going to document my journey into understanding them.  It is also a convenient place to store references to the material for later use.

Here's a list of current grok projects:

* 1. Linear Programming (made enough progress for now).

* 2. Working through CLRS algorithms book with C++.

Future grok projects:

1. Basic search algorithms

2. Graph algorithms

3. Kalman filter

4. Signal processing (at least the basics)

5. Threading and async programming

6. Network programming (at least the basics) NB: this is taking place w/ the help of "Black Hat Python." There's a repo by that name where I'm dropping code for now.

7. ML algorithms: Neural networks (various types), regression, classification, etc.  I'll probably use a lot of EoSL.

8. Geometric interpretation of Gaussian elimination (probably not enough for it's own thing, but super important for LP).

9. Data structs and algorithms
	
	a. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures

	b. Make a short summary of the details of each (complexity, uses, examples)

	c. Make a few examples of applications where they could be used.
	
	d. Lots of examples with pointers (to structs, arrays of various types, etc)
